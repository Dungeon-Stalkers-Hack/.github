## **Comparison with Other Cheats**

While other fantasy dungeon hacks focus mostly on aimbots, this one’s loaded with dungeon-specific extras – loot ESP, trap detection, and stealth buffs. Most cheats from generic menus won’t have these environment-aware features, so you’ll still miss key loot or fall for traps. This one’s built for the *actual* Dungeon Stalkers experience.
